	      IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) to a new "IASA 2.0" structure <xref target="RFC-Struct"/>. 
		Key IASA 2.0 changes have been
		 specified in a series of documents, including

		<xref target="RFC-7437bis"/>.</t>
		    
	<t>In addition to more substantive

	<section title="Remove Text About the Connection Between the IAOC and IETF Trust">

	<section title="Replacement of the IETF Executive Director position with the Managing Director, IETF Secretariat">
	   <t>Under the IASA 2.0 structure, the responsibilities associated with the position that was referred to as 
		   the IETF Executive Director, are now managed by the position known as the Managing Director, IETF 
		   Secretariat. The latter title, IETF Executive Director, has been assigned new and different 
		   responsibilities as outlined in <xref target="RFC-Struct"/>.</t>
		
	   <t> This document applies that change to the following:
		  <list style="symbols">
			 <t><xref target="RFC2028"/>, The Organizations Involved in the IETF Standards Process, 
				 Section 3.3. This means that the administrative functions necessary to 
				 support the activities of the IETF are performed by a Secretariat, led by the 
				 Managing Director, IETF Secretariat, and consisting of his or her staff in 
				 the IETF Secretariat.</t>
			  
			 <t><xref target="RFC2418"/>, IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures, Section 1. The change

				 of the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG). </t>
			  
			  <t><xref target="RFC3710"/>, An IESG Charter, Section 2. The change means that the Managing 
				  Director, IETF Secretariat, serves as an ex officio member of the IESG. This is 
			  consistent with the above-noted update to <xref target="RFC2418"/>.</t>
			  
	<!-- Depending on responses to Bob Hinden's 20181109 note, maybe..

	<section title="Remove the IETF Executive Director as an Option">
	   <t> In a few cases, it is no longer appropriate for either the IETF Executive
		  Director or the Managing Director, IETF Secretariat to perform a particular 
		   function. These documents are updated to remove mention of the IETF Executive 
		   Director from the list of people with specific responsibilities or authority and 
		   will not be updated to the Managing Director, IETF Secretariat.</t>
	  
	   <t> This document applies that change to the following:
		  <list style="symbols">
			 <t><xref target="RFC3005"/>, IETF Discussion List Charter, in the section 
				 entitled Charter for the IETF Discussion List. This document is updated 
				 to remove the IETF Executive Director from the list of those allowed
